I know, I know I''ve let you down

I''ve been a fool to myself

I thought that I could live for no one else

But now through all the hurt and pain

It''s time for me to respect

The ones you love mean more than anything


------------------------------------------------


So with sadness in my heart

Feel the best thing I could do

It''s end it all

And leave forever

What''s done is done it feel so bad

What once was happy now is sad

I''ll never love again

My world is ending



------------------------------------------------



I wish that I could turn back time

Cause now the guilt is all mine

Can''t live without the trust from those you love

I know we can''t forget the past

You can''t forget love and pride

Because that it''s killing me inside


------------------------------------------------




It all returns to nothing

It all comes tumbling down tumbling down tumbling down

It all returns to nothing

I just keep letting me down letting me down letting me down


------------------------------------------------




In my heart of hearts

I know I could never love again

I''ve lost everything everything

Everything that matters to me matters in this world



------------------------------------------------



I wish that I could turn back time

Cause now the guilt is all mine

Can''t live without the trust from those you love

I know we can''t forget the past

You can''t forget love and pride

Because that it''s killing me inside


------------------------------------------------




It all returns to nothing

It just keeps tumbling down tumbling down tumbling down

It all returns to nothing

I just keep letting me down letting me down letting me down



------------------------------------------------



Up up up up up

Tumbling down tumbling down tumbling down

Up up up up up

Letting me down letting me down letting me down

Up up up up up

Tumbling down tumbling down tumbling down

Up up up up up

Letting me down letting me down letting me down
