It seems in one night
`all <http://blog.yxwang.me/2011/11/migrated-to-octopress/>`_
`geeks <http://xoyo.name/2012/02/migrate-to-octopress/>`_
have
`their <http://blog.xdite.net/posts/2011/10/07/what-is-octopress/>`_
`own <http://www.yangzhiping.com/tech/octopress.html>`_
`Github User Page <http://pages.github.com/#user__organization_pages>`_
and Octopress_ Blog.
Like everyone posted in their blogs, Static Blog is indeed more convenient than traditional 
Blog systems such as WordPress. I have been wanting my own Octopress_ since then.

But it seems that Octopress_ isn't for me
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

At first I was confused  by `Setup Steps of Octopress <http://octopress.org/docs/setup/>`_ .  What is this RVM_ thing? 
And what is that rbenv_ thing? It seems  the high pace of Ruby community has beyond my imagination to a degree that 
they need a version manager to ensure the compatibility of different versions of Ruby. Althrough the same compatibility  
issue also troubles Python community [#]_ , but at least Python don't need a version manager (yet) to control this mass [#]_ .

Real problem for me is that I haven't yet a Linux box that I can play around freely. (I really want one ... ) Both RVM_ and 
rbenv_ needs to run on Unix/Linux/MacOSX. One can not be a geek if he use Windows ? (Maybe it's true...)

Remaining problem is the battle between Ruby and Python campaign.  I haven't tried Markdown_ , and I rather like ReST_ . 
It seems that both sides depend on Pygments_ as code block highlighter so  Rubyists need Python environment anyway. 
I simply don't want to depend on any Ruby component. It is better when it is in pure Python, no C extensions so that I can 
debug into it and make minor modifications.

So I started searching for Static Blog Engine in Python on Github. The author of the great framework Flask_ , mitsuhiko_ , 
wrote a rstblog_ , but it's not well developed. Hyde_ seems to be complete enough, but it use MarkDown_ as its default markup 
language, and the design of its homepage is too fashion to be used as blog. Finally I found Pelican_ .

.. [#] Such as the difference between Python 2.x and 3.x , and also difference in C-API of implementations of PyPy_ , CPython_ , Stackless_ , Cython_ .

.. [#] Yes, we have easy_install_ and pip_ , but all these are package manager, running in a perticular Python implementation. Python implementation itself don't need a manager. Version issue of Python largely have been solved by lightweight converters such as 2to3.py_ and 3to2.py_ , you don't need to store multiple implementations of Python in your disk for different packages. Yes you can use  virtualenv_ if you need to preserve stablility but this is another story.

Let it be Pelican_
++++++++++++++++++

For my own use, Pelican_ offers me some advantages over Octopress_:

 #. Implemented in **pure Python**. This means that I can use different implementation of Python other than CPython easily. I use PyPy_ myself.
 #. Translation of multi-languages. The original author of Pelican_ is a France. This is unnecessory for most people, but I will post my blog mainly in three languages: English, Japanese and Chinese.
 #. ReST_ . So that I can use the @auto-rst feature of Leo_ . And also I don't need to switch between my blog and documentation of my projects.

But it seems that Pelican_ was less contributed than Octopress_ . Some minor issues remains in latest version:

 #. Support of pelican-import from WordPress for Chinese and Japanese articles are buggy.
 #. Datetime format, timezone, and locale support for multi-language blogs are not so natural. **I will work on this in these days**
 #. There are not so many templates compared to Octopress_ .
 #. And less plugins .

I hope more people from Python community can contribute to this excellent project, then all these issues will be fixed soon.

My settings
+++++++++++

To install Pelican_ is simple:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install pelican

Write posts in ReST_ , with ``rst`` extensions, and put them in ``pages`` folder. (Re)Build all pages is simply:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pelican -s settings.py
    
Push to Github:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git commit -am "Commit message"
    $ git push

And following is my ``settings.py``:

.. code-block:: python
